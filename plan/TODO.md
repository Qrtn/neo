- Compare bots with different paths => TOP PRIORITY
- Test on SPIMarena

### Low Priority

- Write about how important improvements in path are. We've maxed out on how
  much the puzzle solver can improve our performance

### Done
- Add ability to tweak speed of puzzle generation => done
- Profile code using -prof_file => done, more improvements can be made with
